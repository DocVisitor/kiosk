# Kiosk app

## install

install module mysql -> When you want to use mysql (change it in config) else this step is optional

```commandline
pip3 install mysql
```

Then download the community edition of mysql. And start mysql.
Now you need to change config data. (much fun, because the config is so beautiful :D) 
(/backend/config.py)

## run

Once installed and mysql server running (when you use mysql) it's very simple to use this app.
On commandline at linux/macos with python3 installed:

```commandline
cd kiosk_folder
python3 run.py
```

at windows:

double click at the python3 run.py and run it (i guess)
